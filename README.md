# sudokuSolver
I coded this sudoku solver to see if the method in which I solved the puzzzles could solve all sudokus. 
This was definitly not the case. The methods I used can solve easier puzzles, but fail to solve hard puzzles. 
I still inculde my methods in this code, but where it fails, a backtracking algorithm will pick up the pieces. 
The algorithm to solve sudoku-like puzzles is an np-complete algorithm. The actual sudoku puzzle is small enough to be solved quickly, with no actual time problems.
